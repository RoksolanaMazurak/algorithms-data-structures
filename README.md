# Electricians
Your company runs electric networks in the village of Vilshanka. The conditional tender was the involvement of local craftsmen, and you had to agree to it. 
These masters are peculiar, and as a result, you have been placed/buried N poles/poles, which are at a distance from one another. 

The problem is that the exact height of each support is unknown - you only know that the height of the support is within [1, heights[i]], and you can only connect the wire to the top of the support (the necessary equipment is already installed there).

You order electric wire for connecting poles from China, and it will ride/float for a long time. You don't know exactly how much wire you need (it depends on the specific heights of the supports), so you want to order exactly as much as you will need for the worst case scenario.

(In other words, you need to find such a sequence of heights of the supports that the wire that connects their tops will be the longest)
