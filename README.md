# Game Server
You are developing an online game for users from all over the country, and you want to place it
central game server so that the maximum delay between the server
and each client was minimal. As a server, you can choose any
a network node that is not a client.
Having information about the network topology (which nodes are connected to which, and what is the delay
of each connection), find the server location that minimizes the most
delay value to the client. Output this latency value.
